has always maintained that Android is safe, even if many users -
and researchers - don't agree with it. So, at I/O in Mountain View, the
company
moved t allay security fears over the Android and launched a new
service called
Play Protect. Part of the Google Play, the Protect will overtly scan
apps on a
phone and let users find out if there are rogue and dangerous apps
running in
the background on their phones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Protect will be inbuilt inside the Play, the app through which
Android users download apps.</span></p><img style="width: 100%; height: 62%;" alt="" src="1.jpg"><br>

Cunningham, product manager at Android security, says that Google
already does enough to keep Android safe. He says that Google's
security
servers constantly scan and keep an eye on the Play store that there
are no
rogue apps in it. "With more than 50 billion apps scanned every day,
our
machine learning systems are always on the lookout for new risks,
identifying
potentially harmful apps and keeping them off your device or removing
them. All
Google Play apps go through a rigorous security analysis even before
they're
published on the Play Store," he says.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; margin-bottom: 21pt; line-height: 21pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">But
Google
acknowledges that there are areas that can be improved. At the same
time, there
is the perception that Google Android is not very safe, and definitely
not as
safe as Apple's iOS. "We know you want to be confident that your
Android
devices are safe and secure," says Cunningham.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; margin-bottom: 21pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">This
is the perception which Google seem to be tackling with the Play
protect. By putting a specific security feature in the phone, and
giving users
control to scan any app at will, Google is trying to bolster people's
perception in the Android.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; margin-bottom: 21pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">The
Play Protect will also allow users to scan the apps that have been
downloaded from the web and not from the Play store. "Play Protect
warns
you about bad apps that are downloaded from other sources too. Play
Protect
watches out for any app that might step out of line on your device,
keeping you
and every other Android user safe," says Cunningham.</span></p><img style="width: 100%; height: 59%;" alt="" src="5.jpg"><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; margin-bottom: 21pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Although
Google has always maintained that Android is very safe, the
Android security is a touchy topic with users, especially in countries
like
India. This is one of the reasons why almost every Android phone in
India
nowadays comes with a security app pre-installed on it. These apps look
similar
to the security apps that people have seen on their computers. These
apps also
claim to offer features like virus scanner, firewall and others that
are
familiar to consumers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; margin-bottom: 21pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 21pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Although
in most cases, these are useless apps given the fact that seem
to inspire confidence among users, they are very popular and it seems
that with
protect Google is trying to keep users away from the so called Android
virus
scanners that in most cases are nothing more than snake oil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
